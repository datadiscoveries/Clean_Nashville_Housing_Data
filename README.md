**Nashville Housing Data Cleaning Project in SQL**

The SQL script in the file "NashvilleHousing" cleans the data in the Excel file "Nashville Housing Data" in preparation for analysis. It does the following:
1. Changes the format of the "SaleDate" field
2. Populates missing property addresses
3. Splits out property and owner addresses so that street address, city and state are in fields of their own
4. Standardizes the "SoldAsVacant" field
5. Removes duplicates
6. Removes unused fields
